Share your lunch order

Technologies

We used express, mongoose, body-parser, md5 and cookie-parser.

We have two models consisting of a user model and order. Within user we set up an email, password, name and order which we set up to work with our orders model. Our orders model consists of restaurant name, details, cuisine, img_url, favorite (cuisine) and when it was last created and updated. We are working primarily in the MEN stack. 

Our users are people that like to share what they eat. It makes ordering for friends based on past preferences easy. It keeps track of cuisines favorited by people and allows a different social experience than Yelp by being more specific highlighting individual dishes. 

We spent about an hour or two brainstorming the idea and eventually came to it as we were taking a lunch break and couldn't figure out what to get the other team members.
